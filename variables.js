//creating an array

//DO NOT OVERRIDE YOUR VARIABLES, USE A CONSTANT if you want a safety NET
var people = ['Daniel', 'Alex' 'Brandon']
// [  ] means index
// DO NOT CREATE AN ARRAY WITH DIFFERENT TYPES, BOOLEANS, STRINGS, NUMBERS
//Length is a property that tells you how many elements are in the arrays
